# Mailfriends Logo

I created the logo several years ago. It's build of 7 circles of the same size - 6 overlapping circles (representing the continents) within one circle (representing the world). Together they form a `M` for `Mailfriends`.

After losing the original files for the logo, I created a SVG version of it in different variants. For the text I use a freeware font named "Sansation", created by Bernd Montag.

Both, the logo and the name `Mailfriends`, are registered trade marks.
